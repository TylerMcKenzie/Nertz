# Nertz
Multiplayer Card Game

## OverView  

   This application utilizes a Node/Express backend, with a React/Redux frontend, and Wepack 2 for asset compilation and hot loading.  Unfortunately I have been unable to finish it at this time. Either an immediate concern came up or I was tasked with creating a different project. 

## Installation

---

1. Install

   Make sure that your Node installaion is 6 or higher(to utilize es6 features).
   ```git clone https://github.com/TylerMcKenzie/Nertz.git``` then move to that directory and run ``` npm install ``` to download local repositories.

2. Run

   Run ```npm start``` to start the application in production mode.  
   To run in development mode (js maps and logs) run ```npm run dev``` this will start webpack in conjunction with HotMiddleware for Hot loading of assets.
